3. **Error Handling and Recovery:**
   Design a producer-consumer system where the producer generates numbers and sends them to the consumer. The consumer processes these numbers but occasionally encounters errors (e.g., invalid data). Introduce an error channel where the consumer can send errors. Implement a mechanism to handle errors gracefully and stop both the producer and consumer when a critical error is encountered.

4. **Graceful Shutdown with Context:**
   Implement a producer-consumer pattern where the producer generates data and sends it to a consumer. Use Goâ€™s `context` package to manage the shutdown process. Ensure that the producer and consumer can be signaled to stop processing when the context is canceled. Verify that all channels are closed properly and resources are cleaned up.

5. **Rate-Limited Producer-Consumer Pattern:**
   Develop a producer-consumer pattern where the producer generates data at a fixed rate and sends it to the consumer. Introduce a rate limit for the producer using a ticker. The consumer should process and print the data. Implement a mechanism to stop the producer and consumer when a specified count of items has been processed or a timeout occurs. Ensure that all channels are closed properly when stopping.
