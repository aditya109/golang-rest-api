1. **Database Query Timeout:**
   - Create a program that simulates a database query which might take varying amounts of time to complete. Use a `select` statement to implement a timeout mechanism. If the query completes within a specified time frame, print the query results; otherwise, print a timeout message.

2. **Network Request Timeout:**
   - Write a program that simulates making a network request that could be delayed. Use a `select` statement to implement a timeout. If the network request completes successfully within the timeout period, print the response; otherwise, print a timeout message.

3. **Concurrent File Processing:**
   - Implement a program that simulates reading data from multiple files concurrently. Use a `select` statement to enforce a timeout on each file read operation. If reading from a file completes within the timeout period, print the contents; otherwise, print a timeout message.

4. **User Input Timeout:**
   - Create a program that prompts the user for input but allows only a certain amount of time for the user to respond. Use a `select` statement to handle the timeout. If the user provides input within the time frame, print the input; otherwise, print a timeout message.

5. **Periodic Task with Timeout:**
   - Design a program that performs a periodic task (e.g., checking a condition) with a maximum allowed duration. Use a `select` statement to manage a timeout for the task. If the task completes successfully within the allowed time, print the result; otherwise, print a timeout message indicating the task took too long.
