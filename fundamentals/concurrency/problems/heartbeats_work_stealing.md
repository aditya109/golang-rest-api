1. **Task Assignment with Timeout:**
   Design a system where a manager goroutine assigns tasks to multiple worker goroutines. Each worker must complete its task within a specified time frame and send a completion message back to the manager. If a worker does not complete its task in time, the manager should reassign the task to another worker. Implement proper synchronization to ensure tasks are not duplicated or lost.

2. **Heartbeat Monitoring with Failover:**
   Implement a system where a central coordinator goroutine distributes different types of messages to several worker goroutines. Each worker must send a heartbeat message back to the coordinator every few seconds. If the coordinator does not receive a heartbeat from a worker within a specific time frame, it should reassign the worker's tasks to other available workers and log the failure. Ensure that the system can handle worker failures gracefully and continue processing.

3. **Dynamic Load Balancing:**
   Create a load balancer system with a manager goroutine that dynamically assigns workloads to multiple worker goroutines based on their current load. Each worker should periodically report its current load and health status. If a worker's load exceeds a certain threshold or if it fails to report status in time, the manager should redistribute the workload among the remaining workers. Implement mechanisms to ensure accurate load reporting and efficient workload distribution.

4. **Worker Health Check with Recovery:**
   Develop a system where a supervisor goroutine monitors several worker goroutines performing tasks. Each worker must periodically send a health check message to the supervisor. If the supervisor detects a worker is unresponsive for a predefined period, it should attempt to restart the worker and reassign its tasks. Ensure that the system can handle worker restarts and task reassignment without data loss or duplication.

5. **Task Resilience with Deadlines:**
   Implement a task scheduling system with a manager goroutine that assigns tasks to worker goroutines with deadlines. Each worker must send a status update message to the manager at regular intervals. If a worker fails to send an update within a specified deadline, the manager should consider the worker as failed, attempt to recover the task, and reassign it to another worker. Design the system to handle task recovery and ensure timely processing of tasks.
