Certainly! Here are some questions that incorporate advanced Go concurrency patterns and features:

### Question 1: Fan-in/Fan-out with Pipelines
You are tasked with processing a large dataset of integers. There are three stages in the pipeline:
1. **Generate**: A goroutine generates a sequence of integers.
2. **Square**: Multiple goroutines take integers from the input channel, square them, and send them to an output channel.
3. **Sum**: A goroutine sums the squared integers from the output channel and sends the final sum to a result channel.

Implement this using fan-in and fan-out patterns with buffered channels.

### Question 2: Mutex and WaitGroup
Write a program where multiple goroutines update a shared counter concurrently. Use a `mutex` to protect the counter and a `WaitGroup` to wait for all goroutines to finish. The program should print the final value of the counter, ensuring no race conditions occur.

### Question 3: Quit Channel with Range and Close
Implement a producer-consumer pattern where the producer generates numbers and sends them to a consumer via a channel. The consumer should process these numbers and print them. Introduce a quit channel that can signal the producer and consumer to stop when a certain condition (e.g., reaching a specific number) is met. Ensure that all channels are properly closed, and use `range` to receive values.

### Question 4: Timeouts Using Select
Create a program that simulates a task that may sometimes take too long to complete. Use a `select` statement to implement a timeout mechanism. If the task completes within a given time frame, print the result; otherwise, print a timeout message.

### Question 5: Heartbeats and Work Stealing
Design a system where a manager goroutine distributes work to multiple worker goroutines. Each worker must send a heartbeat message back to the manager every few seconds to indicate it is still alive. If a worker does not send a heartbeat within a specific time frame, the manager should consider the worker failed and redistribute its work to other workers.

### Question 6: Timeouts and Cancellations
Implement a function that simulates a long-running operation, such as a database query. Allow this function to be canceled if it takes too long. Use context with cancellation to handle the timeout and ensure that the function can gracefully terminate when canceled.

Each question explores different concurrency aspects and patterns in Go, providing a comprehensive understanding of the language's concurrency model.
