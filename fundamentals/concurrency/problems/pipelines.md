1. **Filtering and Transformation Pipeline:**
   - You need to filter and transform a dataset of strings. The pipeline stages are:
     1. **Read**: A goroutine reads strings from a file and sends them to an output channel.
     2. **Filter**: Multiple goroutines take strings from the input channel, remove any strings containing a specific substring, and send the remaining strings to an output channel.
     3. **Transform**: Multiple goroutines convert the filtered strings to uppercase and send them to a final output channel.
     4. **Collect**: A goroutine collects the transformed strings and writes them to a new file.
   - Implement this pipeline using fan-in and fan-out patterns with buffered channels.

2. **Data Aggregation Pipeline:**
   - Create a pipeline to process a large dataset of floating-point numbers:
     1. **Source**: A goroutine generates random floating-point numbers.
     2. **Transform**: Multiple goroutines take numbers from the input channel, multiply each by a factor of 1.5, and send the results to an output channel.
     3. **Aggregate**: A goroutine aggregates the transformed numbers by computing the average and sends the result to a result channel.
   - Ensure that the pipeline handles the data efficiently and terminates properly after processing all numbers.

3. **Logging and Error Handling Pipeline:**
   - Design a pipeline to process log entries:
     1. **Parse**: A goroutine reads raw log entries and parses them into structured objects, sending them to an output channel.
     2. **Filter**: Multiple goroutines filter out log entries based on severity levels (e.g., only pass "ERROR" level entries).
     3. **Store**: A goroutine stores the filtered log entries in a database and sends a count of stored entries to a result channel.
   - Implement this using fan-in and fan-out patterns with buffered channels, ensuring proper error handling and logging of pipeline status.

4. **Real-time Data Processing Pipeline:**
   - Implement a pipeline to process sensor data in real-time:
     1. **Capture**: A goroutine captures raw data from sensors and sends it to an output channel.
     2. **Normalize**: Multiple goroutines take the raw data, normalize it to a standard range, and send the normalized data to an output channel.
     3. **Analyze**: A goroutine analyzes the normalized data to detect anomalies and sends alerts to a result channel.
   - The pipeline should handle high-throughput data and ensure minimal latency in processing.

5. **Image Processing Pipeline:**
   - Develop a pipeline for processing images:
     1. **Load**: A goroutine reads images from disk and sends image objects to an output channel.
     2. **Process**: Multiple goroutines perform various image processing tasks (e.g., resizing, filtering) on the images and send the processed images to an output channel.
     3. **Save**: A goroutine saves the processed images to disk and sends a success message to a result channel.
   - The pipeline should be able to handle large image files efficiently, using buffered channels to manage flow control.
